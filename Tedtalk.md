**Travel and Tourism**
* **Benefits:**  
  * If an instant, reliable, accurate image recogniion could be implamented into airport security, it could significantly reduce the wait times for security and immigration. This could improve the capacity of airports, allowing more tourists to come in per year. Hotels could also implament the technology to improve the persoalisation for customers. This could allow staff to greet them by name and use the booking information to ensure they get a service that is suited to them. An example of this is in a Marriot Hotel in China where the technology is already being implamented.
* **Limitations**  
  * If a person is wearing a mask, sunglasses or anything to cover their face, the image recognition software may become useless as it will not be able to define the key features it is looking for. Also, the software may be liable to hackers who want to steal the software or edit it to remove some of the criterias the software is looking for
* **Risks**  
  *  Like with any technology, there are potential risks that are needed to be taken into account such as threats to privacy, violations of rights, potential data theft along with others. There are also risk of error in the technology if there is a bug or flaw in the technology that was not noticed prior to introduction.

**Travel and Tourism**
* **Benefits:**  
  *  Hotels could implament quick, efficient and easy facial recognition technology to improve the persoalisation for customers. This could allow staff to greet them by name and use the booking information to ensure they get a service that is suited to them. An example of this is in a Marriot Hotel in China where the technology is already being implamented.
* **Limitations**  
  * If a person is wearing a mask, sunglasses or anything to cover their face, the image recognition software may become useless as it will not be able to define the key features it is looking for. Also, the software may be liable to hackers who want to steal the software or edit it to remove some of the criterias the software is looking for
* **Risks**  
  *  Like with any technology, there are potential risks that are needed to be taken into account such as threats to privacy, violations of rights, potential data theft along with others. There are also risk of error in the technology if there is a bug or flaw in the technology that was not noticed prior to introduction.


**Gaming and Entertainment**
* **Benefits**  
  * The face id can be used to identify if a person purchasing the game is of age to play the game. If it is a 16 year old trying to buy a game rated 18 for example, the face id can scan the persons face and find the age
* **Limitations**  
  * It is slightly unnecasary for a computer game shop to have the data for all of the people in the country. This could leave them susceptible to hackers targeting the weak system.



**Education and Learning**
* **Benefits**  
  * Introducing a seamless facial recognition system into schools and universities could allow a previously time consuming process such as attendance tracking could be cut down significantly to only a few minutes per class. The technology will also improve security as it provides a quick way of verification of the students.
* **Limitations**  
  * If a student's face changes, then they will have to get their photo retaken which could take a long time.
* **Risks**  
  * With the technology, the student's faces along with all of their personal data will have to be stored somewhere.  If that place is hacked it could lead to many problems regarding security and privacy with all of the student's data being revealed

**Transport and Navigation**
* **Benefits**  
  * If an instant, reliable, accurate image recogniion could be implamented into airport security, it could significantly reduce the wait times for security and immigration. This could improve the capacity of airports, allowing more tourists to come in per year.
* **Limitations**  
  * If a customer is wearing something over their face, the technology won't be able to pick them up - this could lead to significant problems in regards to security as airports are a major target for criminals. 
* **Risks**  
  * The criminals may cause significant damage to the airport


**Medcine and Healthcare**
* **Benefits**  
  * The use of computer vision in medical imaging analysis has many benefits. It lessens the time medical professionals take in analyzing images. Object recognition can accurately identify features in images faster and more accurately than people. Often these discoveries can take place when formations are smaller, allowing earlier detection, which can save lives and lessen the severity of treatment
* **Limitations**  
  * If a patient has a particularly rare or unknown condition, the computer may not be able to pick it up - meaning the patient won't be able to get treatment.
